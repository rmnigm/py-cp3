# Procrustes analysis

## Task
For sets of data, the goal is to split them into clusters of similar figures using procrustes transformation.
Principal component analysis is used for decomposing the matrix of pairwise distances and clustering algorithms from scikit-learn.

## Procrustes
The orthogonal Procrustes problem is a matrix approximation problem in linear algebra. In its classical form, one is given two matrices $A$ and $B$ and asked to find an orthogonal matrix 
$\Omega$ which most closely maps A to B. The approach can be used to transform the figures and check whether they are similar or not.
