# Unstable orbits

## Task
Compute the initial speeds required to maintain stable orbits for a grid of starting positions in a
constrained three-body problem of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
If a point intersects a plane too far from the libration point, the orbit is unstable because the speed is too high.
Mechanics!

## Three-body problem
The constrained three-body problem poses interesting dynamics in mechanics. Computational techniques
such as numerical integration methods, including the Runge-Kutta method, are very useful. The equations
in this code have been transformed into a system of ODEs with minimum number of constants.
Oh, and the mathematical integrity of the problem remains intact.

## Some links
Here is an [article](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wafy1jaylclngbv/Aksenov_ASR.pdf?dl=0) by Stanislav Bober and Sergey Aksenov that discusses the mapping of initial points with numerical computation.
This process is not confined to just starting speeds on one axis but extends to many more dimensions to create detailed maps.
Both Stanislav Bober and Sergey Aksenov where my uni teachers who guided me through mechanics and Python for physics.
