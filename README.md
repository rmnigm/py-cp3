# Python for science and engineering
This is a repository, containing homeworks of Python course in 3rd year of Applied Math undergraduate program.
Tasks are mostly computationally complex problems from physics or mathematical modelling, which require creating a high-performance model and creating visualizations.

Homeworks are annotated in russian language.
**Currently solved:**
- Ferromagnetic energy Izing model
- Lyapunov's fractal interactive map
- Procrustes analysis for sets of 3-dimensional figures
- Heat transfer modelling in 2-dimensional space
